# Eliza-Chatbot--NLP
Used the Python programming language to implement a simple version of an Eliza style chatbot—Eliza, originally developed in the 1960s by Dr. Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT,
mimicked the responses a Rogerian psychotherapist would say during a therapy session. Our challenge was to redevelop the speech pattern recognition algorithm 
that determines the key word or phrase in a user’s input sentence and generates an appropriate response. Ideally, the program will seem to the user like a natural 
text-based conversation with a Rogerian therapist and not an obvious chatbot.
